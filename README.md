Backend


In this repository, I will create a Backend folder containing various subfolders such as controllers and config, among others.

Configuration

In the config folder, I have configured the database using MongoDB in the db.js file. This file establishes the connection with the database.

Learning Journey

During my journey of learning backend development, I focused on establishing connections with databases. Understanding how to connect to the database is fundamental in backend development.

Models

Once the connection to the database is established, I proceeded to create models for my project. These models define the structure of the data, such as user profiles or other entities, that will be stored in the database. This is achieved by creating schemas for the database.
